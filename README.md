- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dschneidauTHEprogrammer

- Iâ€™m interested in machine learning which means I am also interested in math by deafult
- Iâ€™m currently training myself at the University of Memphis, majoring in both Computer Science and Math
  I LOVE anything with machine learning and classification. Reinforcement learning, NLP, deep neural networks... I am into it all!
  
- I will continue to upload my code here for you all to investigate, and PLEASE let me know if I missed an easier way to do anything!
